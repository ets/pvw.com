I first heard the phrase "Post Virus World" used to reference the inevitable changes we anticipate in the wake of COVID-19 [by MIT's Simon Johnson](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/simon-johnson) when we discussed his work at [Covid Alliance](https://www.covidalliance.com/) mid-March. That conversation inspired the creation of this website. Please contribute to this dynamic collection of resources.
