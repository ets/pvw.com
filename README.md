_Wouldn't that be nice?_

This repo started as a personal experiment with [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) and the [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). Since hosting is free and I found the combination quite easy to use - I saw no reason not to actually publish a few meditations on Coronavirus.

[Your contributions are welcome](contributing.md).

Here's the forked [Hylia theme README](hylia_readme.md).
